# PsychopyCodes
Here, I upload all codes (99% Psychopy Coder) which I use in my experiments. these are for free to use; if you would like to update them, you may kindly also let me know

## [Progress Bar for Experiment Duration](https://github.com/Eithankhodami/PsychopyCodes/blob/main/Screen%20Size%20detector.py) (Pgbar height)

This is a progress bar designed to indicate the duration of your experiment, which is preset to 180 seconds (3 minutes). You can easily incorporate this code snippet into your project and adjust its location within your experiment. If you desire a larger or smaller progress bar, you can modify the "height" parameter.

### Usage Notes
- The primary settings of this progress bar are configured based on the screen's degree measurement. If your experiment uses different units of measurement, you may need to adapt the values for the `height`, `position`, and `size` parameters accordingly.

## [Screen Size Detecor](https://github.com/Eithankhodami/PsychopyCodes/blob/main/Screen%20Size%20detector.py)
This code is designed to detect your screen size, and later, you can use parameters including `height` and `width` if you want to insert stimuli or divide the screen based on your needs.

## [Adapted code for EyeLink Eye tracker and Psychopy](https://github.com/Eithankhodami/PsychopyCodes/tree/main/Native%20EyeLink%20Psychopy%20adaption%20for%20coder)
⛔Tested with Psychopy Version 2023.x.x not earlier <br><br>
This code Provides clean [Eye-Link Eye-tracker](https://sr-research.com/support) for [Psychopy Coder](https://psychopy.org/coder/index.html) to integrate including calibration, validation and recording experiments and provide *.EDF file at the end. <br><br>
