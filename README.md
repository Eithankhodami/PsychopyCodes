# ![Progress Bar for Experiment Duration](https://github.com/Eithankhodami/PsychopyCodes/blob/main/Screen%20Size%20detector.py) (Pgbar height)

This is a progress bar designed to indicate the duration of your experiment, which is preset to 180 seconds (3 minutes). You can easily incorporate this code snippet into your project and adjust its location within your experiment. If you desire a larger or smaller progress bar, you can modify the "height" parameter.

## Usage Notes
- The primary settings of this progress bar are configured based on the screen's degree measurement. If your experiment uses different units of measurement, you may need to adapt the values for the `height`, `position`, and `size` parameters accordingly.
